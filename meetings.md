# Meeting 11/19

- Katherine, Songyang and me met to talk about the expectations of the project
- We will analyze the potato dataset with a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques
- We will work on this project Spring 2020
- We will produce a report by the end of the semester summarizing results
- We discussed the "Rules of the game":
    - Need to study: https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming
    - Document everything you do clearly (in Rmd or jupyter notebook)
    - Make sure your code is commented and easy to understand for others
    - Keep most updated version in github
    - Do not push data, PDF, images or big files to github
    - We will meet weekly (we will find time in January)
    - Feel free to email or schedule meetings ahead of time if problems arise, always better to ask questions sooner!


Next steps:
- study mindful programming, and other resources: test pushing things to github
- read Rick's paper
- wait for data
- read Suha paper?

Next steps January:
- Meet the first week of class (Jan 21), send doodle poll
